# Minecraft Asset Reference

When the user asks to check for asset changes between Minecraft versions, use the minecraft-assets
repository as a reference:

**Repository**: https://github.com/InventivetalentDev/minecraft-assets

- Every Minecraft version is available as a tag in this repository.
- Compare tags to identify changes in vanilla assets between versions.
- Common changes include texture file renames, model structure updates, and recipe format changes.

**Example**: Between Minecraft 1.21.4 and 1.21.5, creaking heart texture files were renamed:
- `minecraft:block/creaking_heart_active` → `minecraft:block/creaking_heart_awake`
- `minecraft:block/creaking_heart_top_active` → `minecraft:block/creaking_heart_top_awake`

**Note**: Only check this repository when explicitly asked by the user. Do not proactively check it
during routine version updates.
